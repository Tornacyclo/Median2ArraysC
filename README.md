# Median2ArraysC
Here's a function that takes in two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 and returns the median of the two sorted arrays.
This function uses a binary search approach to find the median in O(log(m+n)) time. It works by partitioning the arrays into two halves and comparing the elements at the boundaries of the partitions. Based on the comparison, it adjusts the partitions and repeats the process until the median is found.
